This book is meant as a high level overview of stormlicht.
Individual methods and structs are documented using `rustdoc` directly next to the code.
To view the `rustdoc` documentation, run `cargo doc --open`.

Like any other documentation, parts of this book are likely outdated by the time you read it.
Changes and fixes of any kind are of course welcome.
